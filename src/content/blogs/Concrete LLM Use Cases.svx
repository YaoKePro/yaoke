I feel like all my blogs are kind of abstract and conceptual, and often meander into no concrete conclusions. This one is as grounded as possible, a list of actual use cases you can apply to your own workflow today using LLMs.
### Research
Deep Research has now been implemented across all the major LLM providers like Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok and more. This is a feature where a LLM agent spends an extended period (tens of minutes) to research a query you send by browsing the web. 

At first I was rather skeptical of its usefulness. After all, a large part of my high school journey has been about Googling things, rephrasing them into reports, and handing them in. Now a machine has taken over that entire workflow. But I've increasingly come to realise that some times, we hold LLMs to unreasonable standards, and sometimes, we are not so honest about our own performance in comparison with LLMs. 

Whilst a dedicated human researcher is still superior in terms of auxiliary effects such as learning knowledge, gaining inspiration, and developing critical skills, the raw quality of research given a strict topic is not necessarily better than a LLM. LLMs excel with abstract concepts, allowing them to effectively transform and extract text. 

A human will never be able to scrape as many pages and understand as many concepts as a machine in ten minutes. Since converting and summarising is a rather low mental effort exercise, LLMs also tend to do a rather good job at it. It may not be as insightful as an expert which can tailor the content to the needs of the user in a personal and *critical* way, but for most scenarios, it really is *good enough*.
